Create organisms that populates the world and see what happens.

Organisms can move, eat, reproduce and fight.

Movement:
    Speed depends on metabolism. A fast metabolism enables fast movement but drains energy faster.
    Think about having terrain, maybe alpha in bitmap?
Metabolism:
    Herbavore:
        Gather energy from "plants". plants grow on the ground
    Carnivore:
        Eat other organisms. can kill them or eat
    Size:
        A bigger organism might be more difficult to kill, but would be easier to find.
Reproduction:
    DNA:
        DNA decides all features of an organism. Organisms can reproduce if the their DNA does not differ too much.
Social:
    Organisms can stay together in groups or shy away from other organisms. perhaps symbiosis between
Fighting:
    A carnivore can kill another organism and eat it.
Sensors:
    Organism uses sensors to find out information about the world.
    Some Organisms could develop camoflage wich would make hem more difficult to find.
World:
    Make it a bitmap with different colours representing different plants.
